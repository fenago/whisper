## Part 2: Business Image Analysis (5 minutes)

### Step 4: Analyze Business Charts and Graphs
Let's analyze a business visualization to extract insights:

```python
# Analyze a business chart or graph
def analyze_business_chart(image_url):
    """
    Extract data and insights from business charts
    """
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        input=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "input_text",

                        "image_url": image_url
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    )
    return response.output_text

# Example: Analyze a sales dashboard
chart_url = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71"
analysis = analyze_business_chart(chart_url)

print("üìä Business Chart Analysis:")
print(analysis)
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

### Step 5: Product Image Analysis for E-commerce
Automate product cataloging and description generation:

```python
# Analyze product images for inventory management
def analyze_product_for_inventory(image_url):
    """
    Extract product details for inventory systems
    """
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        input=[

                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "input_text",
                        "text": """Analyze this product image for our inventory system:

                        "type": "input_image",
                        "image_url": image_url
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    )
    return response.output_text

# Example: Analyze a product for cataloging
product_url = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542291026-7eec264c27ff"
product_details = analyze_product_for_inventory(product_url)

print("üè∑Ô∏è Product Inventory Analysis:")
print(product_details)
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

### Step 6: Extract Text from Business Documents
OCR capabilities for digitizing paper documents:

```python
# Extract text from scanned documents or receipts
def extract_text_from_document(image_url):
    """
    OCR for business documents, receipts, invoices
    """
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        input=[

                    },
                    {
                        "type": "input_image",
                        "image_url": image_url
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    )
    return response.output_text

# Example: Extract text from a document
document_image = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554224155-6726b3ff858f"
extracted_text = extract_text_from_document(document_image)

print("üìÑ Document Text Extraction:")
print(extracted_text)
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")

## Part 3: Corporate PDF Processing (5 minutes)

### Step 7: Financial Report Analysis
Process quarterly earnings and annual reports:

```python
# Analyze financial reports
def analyze_financial_report(pdf_url):
    """
    Extract key financial metrics from corporate reports
    """
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        input=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "input_text",
                        "text": """Analyze this financial report and extract:

                        3. Key performance indicators mentioned
                        4. Major risks or challenges noted
                        5. Executive summary in 3 bullet points
                        
                        Format as an executive brief."""
                    },

                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    )
    return response.output_text

# Example: Analyze Berkshire Hathaway annual letter
report_url = "https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2023ltr.pdf"
financial_summary = analyze_financial_report(report_url)

print("üí∞ Financial Report Analysis:")
print(financial_summary)
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

### Step 8: Contract and Legal Document Review
Automate contract analysis for key terms:

```python
# Review contracts for important terms
def review_contract(pdf_url):
    """
    Extract key terms from contracts and agreements
    """
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        input=[

                        3. Key deliverables
                        4. Important dates/deadlines
                        5. Termination clauses
                        6. Liability/penalty clauses
                        
                        Highlight any unusual or high-risk terms."""
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "input_file",
                        "file_url": pdf_url
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    )
    return response.output_text

# Example with a public filing
contract_url = "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872423000013/amzn-20221231.pdf"
contract_review = review_contract(contract_url)

print("‚öñÔ∏è Contract Review Summary:")
print(contract_review)
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

## Part 4: Internal Document Upload (4 minutes)

### Step 9: Create and Upload Internal Documents
Since the API only accepts PDFs, we'll create a helper function:

```python
# Helper function to create PDFs from text
def create_pdf_from_text(text_content, filename="document.pdf"):
    """
    Convert text content to PDF for upload
    """
    c = canvas.Canvas(filename, pagesize=letter)
    width, height = letter
    
    # Set up formatting
    margin = 50
    y_position = height - margin
    line_height = 15
    max_width = width - (2 * margin)
    
    # Process text
    lines = text_content.split('\n')
    
    for line in lines:
        if y_position < margin:  # New page if needed
            c.showPage()
            y_position = height - margin
        
        if line:
            wrapped_lines = simpleSplit(line, "Helvetica", 12, max_width)
            for wrapped_line in wrapped_lines:
                c.drawString(margin, y_position, wrapped_line)
                y_position -= line_height
        else:
            y_position -= line_height
    
    c.save()
    return filename

# Create a sample business memo
memo = """INTERNAL MEMO

## üéØ Challenge: Build a Document Intelligence System

Create a comprehensive document processing system for your business operations.

### Requirements:
1. **Process Multiple Document Types**: Handle invoices, contracts, and reports
2. **Extract Structured Data**: Return data in a format ready for databases
3. **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple documents efficiently
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle various file formats and errors

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

**"Invalid file format" error:**
- Solution: Convert to PDF using the `create_pdf_from_text()` function
- The API only accepts PDF files, not .txt, .docx, etc.

**"File too large" error:**
- Solution: PDFs must be under 20MB
- Consider splitting large documents

**"Rate limit exceeded":**
- Solution: Implement delays between requests
- Use exponential backoff for retries
