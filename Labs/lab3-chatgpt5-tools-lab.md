**Prerequisites:** Basic Python knowledge, Google account  
**Objective:** Learn to use ChatGPT 5's web search tool for real-time information

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Enable web search in ChatGPT 5 responses
- Get real-time information for business decisions
- Research competitors and market trends
- Build automated research workflows

---

## Part 1: Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your Notebook
1. Go to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Click **"New Notebook"**
3. Rename to `ChatGPT_5_Web_Search_Lab`

### Step 2: Install and Import
```python
# Install OpenAI library
!pip install openai --quiet

# Import what we need
from openai import OpenAI
from getpass import getpass
from datetime import datetime
```

### Step 3: Initialize Client
```python
# Enter your API key securely
api_key = getpass('Enter your OpenAI API key: ')

# Create the client
client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)

print("‚úÖ Ready to search the web with ChatGPT 5!")
```

---

## Part 2: Basic Web Search (5 minutes)

### Step 4: Your First Web Search
Let's start with a simple search for current information:

```python
# Basic web search example
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search"}],
    input="What was a positive business news story from today?"
)

print("üì∞ Today's Positive Business News:")
print(response.output_text)
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

**What's happening:**
- `tools=[{"type": "web_search"}]` enables web search
- ChatGPT 5 searches the internet for current information
- Returns real-time results, not just training data

### Step 5: Get Current Market Information
Search for real-time market data:

```python
# Get current market information
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search"}],
    input="What are the current stock market indices (DOW, S&P 500, NASDAQ) and how are they performing today?"
)

print("üìà Current Market Status:")
print(response.output_text)
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

### Step 6: Research Specific Companies
Get the latest information about any company:

```python
def research_company(company_name):
    """
    Get current information about a company
    """
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        tools=[{"type": "web_search"}],
        input=f"""Find the latest information about {company_name}:
        - Recent news or announcements
        - Stock price movement today
        - Any major developments
        Keep it concise - 3-4 bullet points."""
    )
    return response.output_text

# Try it with different companies
companies = ["Apple", "Tesla", "Microsoft"]

for company in companies:
    print(f"üè¢ Latest on {company}:")
    print(research_company(company))
    print("-" * 40)

print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

---

## Part 3: Business Research Applications (5 minutes)

### Step 7: Competitor Analysis
Monitor what competitors are doing:

```python
# Research competitor activity
def check_competitor(competitor_name):
    """
    Get latest competitor information
    """
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        tools=[{"type": "web_search"}],
        input=f"""What has {competitor_name} announced or done in the last 7 days?
        Include:
        - Product launches
        - Business changes
        - Partnerships
        - Any other significant news
        If nothing significant, say so."""
    )
    return response.output_text

# Monitor a competitor
competitor_update = check_competitor("Amazon")
print("üéØ Competitor Intelligence - Amazon:")
print(competitor_update)
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

### Step 8: Industry Trend Research
Stay updated on industry trends:

```python
# Research industry trends
def research_trend(industry, topic):
    """
    Research current trends in an industry
    """
    query = f"What are the latest developments in {industry} regarding {topic}? Focus on news from the last 30 days."
    
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        tools=[{"type": "web_search"}],
        input=query
    )
    return response.output_text

# Research different trends
trends = [
    ("retail", "AI adoption"),
    ("finance", "cryptocurrency regulation"),
    ("healthcare", "telemedicine growth")
]

for industry, topic in trends:
    print(f"üîç Trend Analysis - {industry.title()} + {topic}:")
    result = research_trend(industry, topic)
    print(result)
    print("\n" + "-"*40 + "\n")

print("="*50 + "\n")
```

### Step 9: Real-Time Price Checking
Get current prices for anything:

```python
# Check current prices
def check_price(item):
    """
    Get current price information
    """
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        tools=[{"type": "web_search"}],
        input=f"What is the current price of {item}? Provide the most recent price you can find with the source."
    )
    return response.output_text

# Check various prices
items = [
    "Bitcoin",
    "Gold per ounce",
    "Oil per barrel (WTI)",
    "Tesla stock"
]

print("üí∞ Current Prices:")
for item in items:
    print(f"\n{item}:")
    print(check_price(item))
    print("-" * 30)

print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        tools=[{"type": "web_search"}],
        input=f"""Create a morning business briefing for {current_date}:

    )
    return response.output_text

# Generate your briefing
print(f"‚òÄÔ∏è Morning Business Briefing - {datetime.now().strftime('%B %d, %Y')}")
print("=" * 50)
print(morning_briefing())
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

### Step 11: Custom Research Reports

```python
def research_report(topic, questions):
    """
    Create a research report on any topic
    
    Args:
        topic: What to research
        questions: List of specific questions to answer
    """
    
    # Format questions
    questions_text = "\n".join([f"{i+1}. {q}" for i, q in enumerate(questions)])
    
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        tools=[{"type": "web_search"}],
        input=f"""Research Report: {topic}
        
        Please research and answer these specific questions:
        {questions_text}
        
        Use current information from the web. Cite sources when possible."""
    )
    return response.output_text

# Create a custom research report
topic = "Electric Vehicle Market 2024"
questions = [
    "What is the current market share of top 3 EV manufacturers?",
    "What new EV models were announced this month?",
    "What is the average EV price in the US currently?",
    "What are the latest government incentives for EVs?"
]

report = research_report(topic, questions)
print(f"üìä Research Report: {topic}")
print("=" * 50)
print(report)
print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")
```

```python
def market_monitor(stock_symbols, sectors):
    """
    Monitor market conditions
    
    Args:
        stock_symbols: List of stock symbols to check
        sectors: List of sectors to monitor
    
    Returns:
        Formatted market update
    """
    
    # TODO: Get current prices for stocks
    # Hint: Use web search for each stock
    
    # TODO: Get sector news
    # Hint: Search for "latest news in [sector] sector today"
    
    # TODO: Find M&A activity
    # Hint: Search for "mergers and acquisitions announced today"
    
    # TODO: Format everything nicely
    
    pass  # Replace with your code

# Test your monitor

## Troubleshooting

**No results returned:**
- Make sure you included `tools=[{"type": "web_search"}]`
- Check your API key has access to tools

**Outdated information:**
- Be specific about timeframes ("today", "last 24 hours", "this week")
- Ask for "latest" or "current" information explicitly

**Rate limits:**
- Add delays between requests if making many calls
- Batch related questions into single prompts when possible
